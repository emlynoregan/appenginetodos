#AppEngine Todos

This project is Jérôme Gravel-Niquet's Todos sample application for Backbone, hosted on AppEngine.

The current version is still backed by Local Storage (ie: AppEngine is being used to provide the
static files for the front-end application). 

The intent of this project is to modify the application to use the AppEngine Datastore as the back end,
removing the use of Local Storage. A future version will accomodate this.
